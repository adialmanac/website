<br>
        I am also familiar with different software development methodologies, such as Agile and Waterfall, and be able to use different tools and technologies, such as version control systems (e.g., Git), integrated development environments (e.g., Eclipse, Visual Studio), and project management software (e.g., Jira).
     <br>   <br>
        Some of the key skills and qualities that I hold are
        <br>
        Strong problem-solving and analytical skills <br>
        Ability to work well in a team <br>
        Attention to detail <br>
        Good communication skills <br>
        Passion for learning and staying up-to-date with new technologies and trends <br><br>
        
        Worked in a variety of industries, such as technology, finance, healthcare, and education ,for large corporations, small startups, and as a freelancer.
        
         Specialized in different areas of software development, such as front-end development (working on the user interface), back-end development (working on the server-side code), or full-stack development (working on both the front-end and back-end).
